# RSA
Old implementation of RSA encryption I did 2 years ago in Java. Unsafe and inefficient implementation that I hope to, overtime, rework into something good. This project I did was not a school project, however I was inspired to do undertake the project while in my Discrete Mathematics class. My professor aided me during office hours in understanding all required algorithms for the RSA implementation. In the meantime feel free to browse the code, see what I did good on, and a lot of what I did bad on.
