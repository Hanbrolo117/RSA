# RSA
This is an implementation of RSA in java I did almost 2 years ago. I did this as a personal project as my discrete mathematics course got me intrigued by the euclidean and extended euclidean algorithms and their applications. However I did not do this alone, my discrete mathematics professor worked with me outside of class to help me wrap my head around all the algorithms and concepts needed to implement RSA. This repo is dedicated to prof. Milos who has inspired me to go out on my own learn things no matter the challenges in the way. I hope to be able to do some restoration on this project to make it what it should be. Currently it is quite inefficient as it uses long instead of BigInteger, which decreases the size of the prime numbers that can be used significantly, but I guess that’s not too bad for only doing java for a couple of months. Either way, hopefully I can eventually get this project restored to a more efficient and well documented state that follows the SEI secure java coding standards. I’m hoping to be pushing to this anytime I can get a chance to work on it, worse case I can work on it over the winter break. The goal of this repo is in dedication to Milos and is to be used as a platform for people and students to learn the RSA implementation, (thus extensive documentation restoration that will explain each step!).
